# password-generator

## Description

This project was to create a website where you can randomly generate a password that can be 8 to 128 characters long containing whatever you want it to whether it be lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numebers, or special characters or even have all of it in your password if you wanted to. This can solve anyone that cannot think of a strong, unpredictable password that can meet the requirements that the website have for creating a password. Creating this helped me get a better understanding on how to JavaScript specifically arrays, for loops, and methods.

To use the password generator, you will need to click the red button labeled 'generate password'. After clicking on it, a pop notification will appear on the top of the screen asking you how long the you want the password to be and that it must be 8 to 128 long, if the user enters something under 8 or above 128, they will be asked to try again and reminded that it needs to be between 8 and 128. After the user enters the appropiate length, they will asked a series of questions on whether or not they want the password to have lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, or special characters. Clicking 'okay' means yes and 'cancel' means no. Once thye finished answering the questions, their randomized password will be displayed in the big box in the middle.
